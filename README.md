  Alertra is a school safety app that integrates student-centered threat assessment into a connected and schoolwide environment.

## Inspiration
Inspired by the countless tragedies and incidents in schools every year, many of which could be avoided by better communication, Alertra is our solution to help improve school safety everywhere. Students are unaware of emergencies due to poor communication from faculty to students, endangering them in some scenarios. When students do encounter safety issues, they are unable to quickly inform others, causing danger to escalate. Alertra solves these communication issues simultaneously, facilitating student-teacher interactions to create a safer workspace.

## What it does
Alertra makes schools safer for both students and teachers. We allow students to report a potentially dangerous incident, where it will be sent to the teachers at the school. If the problem is something they cannot address by themselves, they can broadcast that report to the entire school, including students, teachers, and other faculty. They can also retrieve references to related incidents around the area for additional information.

## How we built it
We built this app using Flutter/Dart for the front-end and Django for the back-end. We also used a python module called selenium to handle all of our web-scraping.

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble gathering datasets for our machine learning algorithm. We also had some trouble finishing on time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to design an app of such high complexity rather than one with basic features. We are proud that we have created an application that is highly applicable and useful in real-world applications.

## What we learned
We learned about managing a full-stack application. We also learned about using Git and Github and how we could use it to our advantage to all collaborate on our project.

## What's next for Alertra
We can try to scan for dangers in the area regularly as opposed to when schools are already signed up. Also, we can implement push notifications.
